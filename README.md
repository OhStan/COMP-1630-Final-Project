# COMP1630 Advanced Topics in Data Analytics FinalProject
This project demonstrates the usage of Structured Query Language (SQL), 
and serves as the final course project for BCIT COMP 1630 - Relational Database Design and SQL.

In this report, the basic features of SQL, such as commands that allow the creation 
of databases and table structures, performing various types of data manipulation and 
administration, and querying the database to extract useful information, will be 
demonstrated using the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). 

Sample commands and results of execution will be provided for various tasks. 
These commands and results of execution should be similar across different relational 
DBMS software that supports SQL. At the end of this report, in the Appendix section, 
a script that contains the complete set of SQL statements used is provided. 

The majority of this tutorial is based on the textbook Database Systems: 
Design, Implementation, & Management, 12th edn, if there is anything that is confusing 
or not easily understood, please consult this textbook for more details.
